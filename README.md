# VaxBuilder
This Python script generates multi-epitope vaccine constructs by combining permutations of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL), and B cell epitopes. It uses predefined linkers and adjuvants to create unique constructs, which are saved in FASTA format for further analysis in vaccine development and immunology.
